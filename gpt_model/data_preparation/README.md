This is rather a collection of various functions that were used
during dataset creation. The code was highly experimental and the exact steps
has not been documented and saved, although it is not that 
difficult to repeat.

The only module that can run as expected is `format_parsed_as_classification_dataset.py`

After all, it should not be a problem, since the resulting datasets are 
accessible via the link:
